        MoneyKakis is a bill-spliting app that makes it easy for your and your friends to track shared expenses. To get
        started, head to the "manage groups" tab and join an existing group or create a new one â€” you'll need to know
        your group's passcode, or you'll need to create one, depending on whether you're joining or creating a group.
        Note that there are no restrictions on the number of groups you can join or create, or on how many members any
        group can have. Once you have joined at least one group, your dashboard will list all groups of which you are a
        member. From your dashboard you can access information about each of your groups, including a list of members
        and a log of all expenses, which includes information about the person who paid for each expense and how much
        money you owe or are owed as a result of it. To add expenses, simply click the "add expense" button corresponding
        to the group you wish to add the expense to and fill out the necessary details. You and your group mates' dashboards
        will be updated to reflect the addition of the new expense.
